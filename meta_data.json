    "description": "This plugin allows you to encrypt and decrypt strings with a secret key using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the CryptoJS library.\n\nThis plugin-in can run both client side and server side.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nRemember to set a secret key in the plugin settings and keep it somewhere safe (losing your key can be painful).\n\nIMPORTANT:\nBe careful about how you use and store your secret key.\n\nNOTE:\nThis plugin supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key.\n\nINFO:\nThe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). It was selected after a 5-year process where 15 competing designs were evaluated.\n\nDEMO:\nhttps://no-code-wizard.bubbleapps.io/version-test/aes",
