    "description": "This plugin allows you to encrypt and decrypt strings with a secret key using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the CryptoJS library.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nRemember to set a secret key in the plugin settings and keep it somewhere safe (losing your key can be painful).\n\nNOTE:\nThe plugin actions can be both client and server side, the server side actions are labeled with the word \"SERVER:\" at the beginning.\n\nNOTE:\nThis plugin supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. It will pick the variant by the size of the key you pass in. If you use a passphrase, then it will generate a 256-bit key.",
